# Audio-Classification-using-Deep-Learning
This project aims to use deep learning techniques for audio classification, with a focus on detecting the presence and density of capuchin birds in specific regions based on 3-second audio recordings. The project will leverage three datasets: capuchin bird audio files, non-capuchin bird audio files, and forest soundscapes.


Introduction: Start with a brief introduction to the project, including its goals and objectives. For instance, you can mention that this project focuses on audio classification using deep learning techniques to detect the presence and density of capuchin birds in specific regions based on 3-second audio recordings.

Dataset: Describe the datasets used in the project. In this case, you can mention that the project leverages three datasets, including capuchin bird audio files, non-capuchin bird audio files, and forest soundscapes.

Preprocessing: Explain the preprocessing steps taken to clean and prepare the audio data for analysis. For instance, you can mention that you used audio signal processing techniques, such as resampling, filtering, and normalization, to standardize the audio data across different recordings.

Model Architecture: Describe the deep learning model architecture used in the project, including the number of layers, activation functions, and optimization algorithms. For instance, you can mention that you used a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract audio features and classify the recordings into capuchin bird, non-capuchin bird, or forest soundscapes.

Model Training: Explain the model training process, including the hyperparameters chosen and the training/validation/testing split. For instance, you can mention that you used a 70/15/15 split for training/validation/testing and that you optimized the learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs to achieve the best results.

Evaluation Metrics: Describe the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the model. For instance, you can mention that you used accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to measure the model's classification performance on the test set.

Results: Summarize the results of the project, including the performance metrics achieved by the model. For instance, you can mention that the model achieved an accuracy of 90% on the test set and that it was able to detect the presence and density of capuchin birds in specific regions based on audio recordings.

Conclusion: Conclude with a brief summary of the project and its significance. For instance, you can mention that this project demonstrates the potential of using deep learning techniques for audio classification and that it has practical applications in wildlife conservation and environmental monitoring.
