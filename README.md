# Audio-Classification-using-Deep-Learning
This project aims to use deep learning techniques for audio classification, with a focus on detecting the presence and density of capuchin birds in specific regions based on 3-second audio recordings. The project will leverage three datasets: capuchin bird audio files, non-capuchin bird audio files, and forest soundscapes.
